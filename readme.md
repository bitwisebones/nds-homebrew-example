# NDS Example

This repo contains an example project for Nintendo DS homebrew.

It uses a modified version of the [256 color bmp](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-examples/tree/master/Graphics/Backgrounds/256_color_bmp) example from the [nds-examples](https://github.com/devkitPro/nds-examples/) repo and includes configuration for a dev container.
